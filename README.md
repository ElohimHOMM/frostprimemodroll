Good day to everyone who reads this,
this is a little tool i threw together during the last meme stream
Just download the code and open the html file, it should open in your browser immediately.

Usage is quite simple, you enter the names above, click the Roll Button and watch the results come in.

It features: 
- Showing which number was rolled and which username had that number
- A list of the last 4 winners at the bottom of the screen
- Not even my watermark, but it would be nice if you told chat who made this :)
